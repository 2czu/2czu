Focused on low-level programming, graphics, and engine development. I tinker with optimization, 3D stuff, and making things run fast.

I enjoy understanding how things work and creating new things.

Currently planning a voxel game engine as a personal project.

## Experience
- **Programming:** C / C++, C#, ASM, Python, TypeScript, graphics programming, engine optimization
- **Creation & Exploration:** 3D modeling (Cinema 4D), digital art (Adobe Illustrator), video editing (After Effects)
- **Curiosity Projects:** Machine learning experiments, pentesting, experimenting with systems
