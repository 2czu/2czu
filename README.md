## About me

Focused on **low-level** programming, **graphics**, and **engine** development. I tinker with optimization, 3D stuff, and making things run fast.

I also enjoy **understanding how** things work and **creating** things.

Currently planning a **voxel game engine** as a personal project.

*(most of my commits were under a different git user)*

## Experience
- **Programming:** C / C++, C#, ASM, Python, TypeScript, graphics programming, engine optimization, algorithms
- **Creation & Exploration:** 3D modeling (Cinema 4D), digital art (Adobe Illustrator), video editing (After Effects)
- **Curiosity Projects:** Machine learning experiments, pentesting, experimenting with systems
